path = route = endpoint (/) last part of url starting from forward slash
operation - reference to any of HTTP request method 
HTTP methods - POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, HEAD, PATCH, TRACE
HTTP - using HTTP you can communicate with each path using one or more methods/operations
FastAPI - python class which provide functionality for api 
app - FastAPI instance
path operation decorator - (@app.get) tells FastAPI that function right below is handling the request that go to the path 
path operation function - this function will be called by FastAPI whenever it receives a request to the specified url
return - dictionary, list, singular values, pydantic models, orm etc
when we declare type in path operation function, fastapi gives  automatic request parsing
fastapi gived you both data validation and data parsing
path order matters - put fixed path first then add dynamic path
request body - When you need to send data from a client to your API, you send it as a request body
response body - A response body is the data your API sends to the client
note - Your API almost always has to send a response body, But clients donâ€™t necessarily need to send request bodies all the time.
